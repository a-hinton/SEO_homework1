# Description

This project is intended to showcase the importance of symantic HTML layouts and clear, concise CSS for improved web accessability and SEO ranking.

# HTML Methodology

Clear, purposeful symantic tags are used in the HTML document to imply the logical structure of the webpage. For instance, the block element which houses the navigation buttons is wrapped in a navigation tag, within a header tag. The main content of the webpage is inclosed in an article tag, denoting the purpose of the element. The side-bar content is wrapped in an aside tag, implying the physical layout of the element.

# CSS Methodology

The CSS content is reduced to the fewest statements necessary to apply to the HTML elements. Multiple sub-sections are covered by individual formatting classes to reduce the amount of code needed.
